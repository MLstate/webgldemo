== Basic 3D collaborative cubic modeler in Opa ==

Currently just a basic demo of WebGL in Opa.
Could evolve into a real modeler.

In a standard 4-views interface, you can add and move cubes.
You can share your work in real time with other users.

REQUIREMENTS
* You need Opa ! (See http://opalang.org or https://github.com/MLstate/opalang)
* You need a recent browser with WebGl capabilities.

BUILDING
 make

LAUNCHING
 ./main.exe
(launches on port 8080)

or
 ./main.exe --server-port nnnn

REMARK
Currently, this project contains the demo and the bindings with WebGL.
Of course, the bindings should go to Opa's standard library at some point.
